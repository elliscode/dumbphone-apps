# I use a flip phone

The year is 2025. I am a software developer, a tech enthusiast, and I am using a flip phone. No, not a foldable smartphone, I use an actual flip phone, and I have been doing so for the past 3 years.

## Why?

There are many reasons, and you are probably familiar with most of them. I was spending too much unproductive time on my smartphone. I was missing out on valuable moments in my life due to the constant need to scroll. I was literally losing sleep, scrolling before bed every night. I felt like instead of making my life better, my smartphone was making my life worse.

I recognize not everyone has these problems, which is why I didn't title this post "I use a flip phone, and you should too".

## How?

You also may be asking yourself, how is that possible in the modern age? Where everything from paying for parking to looking at a QR code menu at a restaraunt requires a smart device, is it even feesible to give up a smart phone for a "dumb" device? 

Well the answer is mostly yes.

### What my phone can do

I will say the one category that flip phones absolutely blow smartphones out of the water is making phone calls. I have always had difficulty using smartphones for phone calls. They're not really ergonomically designed for a face, and my mouth is often so far away from the microphone that people would have trouble hearing me.

It has all the basic apps you would expect: camera, voice memos, calendar, alarm clock, notes, calculator, weather, news, pretty much anything that comes pre-installed on a smart phone, a KaiOS phone will have a native equivalent to.

There's a surprising list of features that almost every KaiOS device currently manufactured comes with: Google Maps, YouTube, and Google Search. They work, which is more than I expected honestly. I have used the built in Google Maps to drive over 500 miles across states and it worked great.

### What my phone can't do

A flip phone can't do apps. Although there is a KaiOS App store, there are only a handful of well maintained, useful apps. I can guarantee you that your bank, your employer, or your gym would not have an app on the KaiOS store.

It also can't be trusted. The operating itself has had some amazingly bad security, and a quick google search for "KaiOS CVE" will show you the alarming severity of these issues. 

### How I fill in the gaps

#### Step 1: Write some code

This might surprise you, but my phone actually does have a halfway decent web browser. It can't load most web pages though. Not through any fault of its own, but due to modern website design. 

Most websites are designed to make money, not for performance, which I completely understand. It just means that anything you want to do on your dumbphone, you will probabyl need a purpose built app.

This might surprise you even more, but the KaiOS operating system my phone runs on actually has its own app store. You can also write your own native apps, but I choose not to. My philosiphy for why basically boils down to the fact that this phone is a piece of garbage, and it might just spontaneously die. The device itself is not important to me, as long as it has an SD card slot and a web browser to access the web apps I write.

So for everything my flip phone needs to do that it cannot, I will at least attempt to write a web page to accomplish the task. I have written a grocery list that my partner and I share, a discord client to keep up to date on my DnD campaign, a Nest Thermostat client to change the temperature of my house from my flip phone, and a calorie tracking app for if I ever decide to lose weight again. This has the added benefit of me having complete ownership of all of my data, which is an issue you've probably at least thought about in recent years.

Anyone can log into my website if they have a working 10-digit phone number, however I would prefer that nobody log into my website. I have no monetization strategy, nor do I plan on making one, and any additional traffic to my website will just run up my AWS bill. It's all open source on my github page, so if you're interested feel free to take a look.

#### Step 2: Have a partner with a smartphone

This is where the "mostly" part of the "mostly yes" answer I gave above comes in. There are just some expereinces and services that you cannot 

If we need to pull up a QR code menu at a restaraunt, pay for parking at a smartphone connected meter, or any other littany of things that are no longer available without a smartphone, my partner will take care of it on their device. The modern world is becoming increasingly hostile to those without a device, simply because everybody is expected to have one.

My phone has a camera capable of taking photos and videos, but it is not very good. It's on par with the first generation consumer grade digital cameras from the early 2000s. For photos of my kids, my flip phone camera will just not cut it.

#### Step 3: Use a tablet

There is only one app I actually cannot live without, and it's the authenticator app I use to log into my computer at work. 

I'm sure it would be technically possible to write a version for my flip phone, and there are some authenticator app options available on the KaiOS store, however as stated above, I cannot trust the security of this device.

### Getting started

If you found any of this interesting, you can get started using a feature phone for very cheap. A great resource for finding information is the r/dumbphones subreddit, which has a finder tool you can use to figure out which phone has all the features you need.
